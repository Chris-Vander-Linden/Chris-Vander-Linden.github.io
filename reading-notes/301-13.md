# Class 13: More CRUD

## This topic matters as it relates to what I am studying in this module because...

Understanding how CRUD relates to REST will allow me to interact with the database.

## CRUD Basics

Which HTTP method would you use to update a record through an API?

PUT

Which REST methods require an ID parameter?

UPDATE and DELETE

## Speed Coding: Building a CRUD API

What’s the relationship between REST and CRUD?

CRUD    | REST
------- | -------
Create  | POST
Read    | GET
Update  | PUT
Delete  | DELETE

If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?

1) Create Express server.

2) Create routes and mount Router.

3) Create Schema and Model.

4) Create and connect DB.

5) Use Mongoose’s REST methods to interact with DB based off of route paths.

## Things I want to know more about.

I’m not entirely sure which methods are NOT middleware.  It seems like almost every function call has been one.  I will have to read more here: 

https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html
