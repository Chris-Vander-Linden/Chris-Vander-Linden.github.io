## This topic matters as it relates to what I am studying in this module because...

Understanding the call stack and error messages will help me debug my code faster.

## Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack

### What is a ‘call’?

function invocation.

### How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?

one.

### What does LIFO mean?

Last in, first out.

### Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.

    // Call stack:

    // console.log
    // function foo
    // function bar
    // function biz


    function foo(){
      console.log('hello');
    };

    function bar(){
      foo();
    };
    
    function biz(){
      bar();
    };

    biz();
