## nosql vs sql

### Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

| SQL                                                 | noSQL|
| :---                                                |:---  |
| Are table based databases                           | Are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores|
| Predefined schemas                                  | Dynamic schema for unstructured data|
| Vertically scalable (require more power to expand)  | Horizontally scalable by adding more servers|
| Use structured query language for defining and manipulating the data| Queries are focused on collection of documents. |
| Better for complex queries                          | Better for large data and scalability              |
