# Class 2: State and Props

## This topic matters as it relates to what I am studying in this module because...

State and props is how React knows which components to re-render. 

## React lifecycle

- Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?

> The render phase.

- What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?

> Mounting.

- Put the following things in the order that they happen:

> constructor, render, componentDidMount, React Updates, componentWillUnmount.

- What does componentDidMount do?

> componentDidMount is used for events that happen outside of the component, such as making API calls.  I think it is similar to the "useEffect" hook in function components.
