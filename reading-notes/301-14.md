# Class 14: Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging

## This topic matters as it relates to what I am studying in this module because...

There are many different non-traditional paths to becoming a software developer.

## That Time When Women Stopped Coding

### What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?

The arrival of personal computers in homes.

### Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?

Computer science professors increasingly assumed that their students had grown up playing with computers at home.

## Why diversity matters to your tech company

### When are diversity efforts most successful?

When theyâ€™re driven by a commitment from company leaders

### Why do diverse companies perform better?

Diversity offers significant benefits for teams focused on creativity and innovation.  Diverse groups of people bring to organizations more and different ways of seeing a problem and, thus, faster/better ways of solving it.

### Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.

When the employees of an organization better represent their users and desired users, they will build more effectively for those groups

## Things I want to know more about.

I'm excited to see that tech companies are beginning to embrace that not everyone's path to sucess is the same.
