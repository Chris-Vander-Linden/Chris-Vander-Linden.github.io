# Class 8: Title

## This topic matters as it relates to what I am studying in this module because...

Learning about desigining APIs will allow me to create more efficient web applications that I can scale larger.

## API Design Best Practices

### What does REST stand for?

Representational State Transfer

### REST APIs are designed around a ____.

resources

### What is an identifier of a resource? Give an example.

Usually a group or item.  In a URL it looks like... https://website.com/group/item/subgroup/subitem

### What are the most common HTTP verbs?

GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH

### What should the URIs be based on?

Parameterized URI paths.

### Give an example of a good URI.

It’s good to alternate from group to item.  Generally, it’s not great to next groups within groups without having an individual item in between.

https://website.com/group/item/subgroup/subitem

### What does it mean to have a ‘chatty’ web API? Is this a good or a bad thing?

This means there are frequent requests to the server.  This can happen if the resources are too small because it requires the user to keep making calls to get all of the data when they could just get a larger chunk and then filter it on their end.  Chatty web APIs are bad.

### What status code does a successful GET request return?

200

### What status code does an unsuccessful GET request return?

404 if the resource can’t be found.

### What status code does a successful POST request return?

201, if created. 
200, if processing happened but no new resource.
204, if there is no content to return.

### What status code does a successful DELETE request return?

204 for no content because it was deleted.

## Things I want to know more about.

Passing certain arguments in the URI that help with filtering.  Such as only returning a certain number of results.
