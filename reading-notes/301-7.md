# Class 7: REST

## This topic matters as it relates to what I am studying in this module because...

REST APIs allow React to dynamically update, since we are just injecting data that conditionally renders the components.

## How I explained REST to my brother

### Who is Roy Fielding?

He is one of the creators of the HTTP specification and the originator of the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style.

### Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use in this class work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

Different machines have different representations of data, so this makes it difficult to communicate.

### What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

It standardizes the data model and which allows for different resources to share the same type of action.

### What does a GET do?

Retrieves informations.

### What does a POST do?

Adds informations.

### What does PUT do?

Replaces informations.

### What does PATCH do?

Partially updates information.

## API Keys

### Did you get your Geocoding API key?

Yes

### Did you get your Weather Bit API key?

Yes

### Did you get your Yelp API Docs key?

Yes

### Did you get your The Movie DB API Docs key?

Yes

## Things I want to know more about.

I think I understand the main differences between SOAP and REST but am a little unclear how GET, POST, etc. are used in SOAP.  Since SOAP is more function based, do these actions just mean something different to each representation of data?  Do they just handle them differently?
