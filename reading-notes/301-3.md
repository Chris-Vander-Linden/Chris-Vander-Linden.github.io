# Class 3: Passing Functions as Props

## This topic matters as it relates to what I am studying in this module because...

...

## React Docs - lists and keys

### What does .map() return?

> A new array of the exact same length.

### If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React?

      items.map(item => <div>{item}</div>);

### Each list item needs a unique ____.

> Key

### What is the purpose of a key?

> Keys help React keep track of changes, so it can rerender.

## The Spread Operator

### What is the spread operator?

> Thy syntax of the spread operator is an ellipsis of three dots (…), which expand an iterable object.

### List 4 things that the spread operator can do.

> Adding an item to a list, using an array as arguments, concatenating or combining arrays, copying an array.

### Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.

       const array1 = [1,2,3];
       const array2 = [4,5,6];
       const newArray = [...array1, ...array2];

### Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.

       const array1 = [1,2,3];
       const newArray = [...array1, 4];
            

### Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.

       const obj1 = {name: "Doug"};
       const obj2 = {name: "Timmy"};
       const newObj = [...obj1, ...obj2];

> ## How to Pass Functions Between Components

### In the video, what is the first step that the developer does to pass functions between components?

> ...

### In your own words, what does the increment function do?

> ...

### How can you pass a method from a parent component into a child component?

> ...

### How does the child component invoke a method that was passed to it from a parent component?
